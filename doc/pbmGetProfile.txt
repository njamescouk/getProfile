# Introduction

This program treats it's image input as a half section of a vessel
and outputs values of radius and height.

This can be used for input into visualisation programs as described in
"[Quantifying the Effects of Raising](raising.pdf)".

# Installation

windows : download [the zip file](https://github.com/njamescouk/pbmGetProfile/archive/master.zip)
 to a location of your choice.

The [directory](.) tree looks like this:

    ├───doc
    ├───example
    └───source
        └───dependencies
            ├───nickPbm
            ├───parseCmdline
            │   └───source
            └───split_string

Windows:
The zip file contains documentation, executable files and supporting dlls
plus source code.

+ doc has a copy of this page and raising.pdf
+ example *should* have everything you need to get 
from a profile image to a table of radius and height: executing runEx.bat
should produce a new can.csv.
+ source executing compile.bat *should* generate pbmGetProfile.exe
from source and dependencies

Linux : In addition I'm afraid you'll have port `source\compile.bat` to linux 
and then compile. 

# Synopsis
~~~~~
pbmgetprofile [-h | -v ] profile_pbm_file
~~~~~

options are:

+    -h          : this help
+    -v          : version

# Action

first use 

    pngtopnm profile_file | pgmtopbm -plain > profile_pbm_file

then 

    pbmgetProfile profile_pbm_file.pbm > profile_file.csv

output is written to stdout

# Example

From the example directory:

!!PP type ..\example\makeEx.bat

So if we start with this image as the profile of a raising:

![](canProfile.shrunk.png)

--------------------


then this is the data produced:

!!PP type ..\example\can.csv | sed  "s/^/    /;"

# Bugs

yes, but I don't know where.

# Building

use `source\compile.bat`
